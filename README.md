# Pivot_and_Mitosheet
Using the Pivot Table  and Mitosheet in the Jupyter NoteBook

1) The Pandas API provides a wide range of functionalities to analyze tabular datasets.

2) Yet, across projects, we often use the same methods over and over to analyze our data. This quickly gets repetitive and time-consuming.

3) To avoid this, use Mito. It's an incredible tool that allows you to analyze our data within a spreadsheet interface in Jupyter, without writing any code.

4) The coolest thing about Mito is that each edit in the spreadsheet automatically generates an equivalent Python code. This makes it extremely convenient to reproduce the analysis later.
